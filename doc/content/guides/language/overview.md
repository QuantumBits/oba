### A lightweight, fast, embeddable, functional scripting language.
---

Oba sports a dynamic, but strong type system and a terse syntax which borrows
designs from Haskell, Rust, and Go.

<!-- example demo -->

* __Oba is small__.  The [implementation] can be skimmed an in afternoon.

* __Oba is functional__. Oba aims to make functional programming more accessible
by providing a simple, terse syntax which should feel accessible to programmers
coming from imperative languages.

* __Oba is a scripting language__. It has no dependencies and is suitable for
writing small tools or for embedding within a larger application.
